**<span style="color:Green">Q. What is version control?</span>**

Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. As development environments have accelerated, version control systems help software teams work faster and smarter.

**<span style="color:Green">Q. What happens if we don't use version control?</span>**

Software teams that do not use any form of version control often run into problems like not knowing which changes that have been made are available to users. Or the creation of incompatible changes between two unrelated pieces (may be worked by 2 people) of work that must then be reworked. If you're a developer who has never used version control, you may have added versions to your files with suffixes like "final" or "latest" and then had to later deal with a new final version. Perhaps you've commented out code blocks because you want to disable certain functionality without deleting the code, fearing that there may be a use for it later. Version control is a way out of these problems.

**<span style="color:Green">How does version control works?</span>**

Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.
