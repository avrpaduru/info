**<span style="color:Green">Q. Different types of version control systems</span>**

Version Control Systems (VCS) are sometimes known as SCM (Source Code Management) tools or RCS (Revision Control System). The two most popular types of version or revision control systems are centralized and distributed. Centralized version control systems store all the files in a central repository, while distributed version control systems store files across multiple repositories. Other less common types include lock-based and optimistic.

**1. Distributed:**

A distributed version control system (DVCS) allows users to access a repository from multiple locations. DVCSs are often used by developers who need to work on projects from multiple computers or who need to collaborate with other developers remotely.

**Examples:** Git, Mercurial, Atlassian BitBucket

**2. Centralized:**

A centralized version control system (CVCS) is a type of VCS where all users are working with the same central repository. This central repository can be located on a server or on a developer's local machine. Centralized version control systems are typically used in software development projects where a team of developers needs to share code and track changes.

**Example:** Apache Subversion (SVN)

**3.Lock-based:**

A lock-based version control system uses file locking to manage concurrent access to files and resources. File locking prevents two or more users from making conflicting changes to the same file or resource.

**4.Optimistic:**

In an optimistic version control system, every user has their own private workspace. When they want to share their changes with the rest of the team, they submit a request to the server. The server then looks at all the changes and determines which ones can be safely merged together.
