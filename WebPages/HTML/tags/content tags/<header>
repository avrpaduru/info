The <header> tag is a semantic HTML element used to define the header section of a webpage or a specific part of the page. It typically contains introductory content, navigational links, or other elements that give context to the page.

Why Do We Need It?
Semantic Clarity:

It provides a clear indication that the content within is related to the header or introduction.
Improves readability and accessibility for developers and assistive technologies.
SEO Benefits:

Search engines understand the <header> tag as a section containing essential context, which can enhance the page's structure in search results.
Modular Design:

Helps organize content into reusable sections, making the layout cleaner and more maintainable.
Support for Navigation:

Often contains navigation elements like <nav> to help users move through the site easily.
Do We Need the <header> Tag in Subpages?
Standalone Subpages:

If the subpage is a complete document (with <html>, <head>, and <body>), you should include a <header> tag to maintain proper semantic structure.
Example:
<header>
    <h1>Subpage Header</h1>
    <p>This is a standalone subpage header.</p>
</header>
Embedded Subpages (Fragments):

If the subpage is a fragment dynamically loaded into the main page, you typically donâ€™t need a <header> tag unless the fragment itself represents a distinct section requiring a header.
