read: semantic equivalent vs dynamic content file before understanding the difference

<div>
What is it? A general-purpose container that doesn't have any specific meaning or semantics.
When to use it? When grouping content for layout or styling purposes, but the group has no particular meaning.
Example:
<div class="feature">
    <h2>Feature Title</h2>
    <p>Details about this feature.</p>
</div>
Why <div>? It's useful when you just need a container, such as for CSS styling or JavaScript targeting.
2. <section>
What is it? A section of content that is part of a larger document. It typically groups content under a common heading.
When to use it? To logically divide a document into meaningful sections, like "About Us," "Features," or "Contact."
Example:
<section id="features">
    <h2>Our Features</h2>
    <p>Explore our amazing features that enhance your experience.</p>
</section>
Why <section>? It groups related content together and adds semantic meaning, making the document easier to navigate for search engines and accessibility tools.
3. <article>
What is it? A self-contained, independent piece of content that could stand alone, like a blog post or news article.
When to use it? For content that is complete and reusable outside of the document.
Example:
<article>
    <h2>Blog Post Title</h2>
    <p>This is a standalone blog post that can be shared individually.</p>
</article>
Why <article>? Each <article> is a distinct, complete piece that can be distributed independently.
