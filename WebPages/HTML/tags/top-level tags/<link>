The <link> tag is used to define a relationship between the current HTML document and an external resource.

Why is it used?
Including External Stylesheets:

In the context of the code, <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> links an external CSS file (styles.css) to the document. This is the primary way to apply styles to an HTML document.
Separation of Concerns:

Using the <link> tag for stylesheets allows you to keep your CSS code separate from HTML, improving readability, maintainability, and reusability.
Preloading and Importing:

The <link> tag can also be used for preloading fonts, importing icons, or specifying alternate stylesheets.
Attributes Explained:
rel="stylesheet": Specifies that the linked resource is a stylesheet.
href="styles.css": Specifies the path to the external CSS file.

NOTE:
you can use the <link> tag in subpages to include external stylesheets, but it depends on how the subpages are structured and loaded.

Scenarios for Using <link> in Subpages:
Standalone Subpages:

If the subpages are complete, independent HTML documents (with <html>, <head>, and <body> tags), they should include their own <link> tag for stylesheets to ensure proper rendering.
Example of a standalone subpage:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Subpage</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h2>This is a Subpage</h2>
    <p>Content specific to this subpage.</p>
</body>
</html>
Embedded Subpages (as part of a main page):

If the subpages are fragments (e.g., just a <div> or <section> loaded dynamically), you do not need to include the <link> tag in the subpage. Instead, the main page's <link> tag will apply the styles globally.
Example of a subpage fragment:

<section>
    <h2>This is a Subpage Fragment</h2>
    <p>Content that will be inserted into the main page.</p>
</section>
This fragment will inherit the styles from styles.css included in the main page.

Best Practices:
Minimize Redundancy: For embedded subpages, rely on the main page's stylesheets to avoid loading the same CSS multiple times.
Use Specificity: Ensure your CSS is modular and uses proper selectors so subpages can inherit styles seamlessly.
