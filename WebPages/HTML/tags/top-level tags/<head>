The <head> tag is a container for metadata and other elements that provide information about the document but are not directly displayed to the user. It plays a critical role in ensuring that a webpage is correctly structured, functional, and optimized for search engines and accessibility.

Why is the <head> tag needed?
1) Metadata Declaration:
Includes the <meta> tags for character encoding (<meta charset="UTF-8">), viewport settings, and descriptions for search engines.
2) Title of the Page:
The <title> tag inside the <head> sets the name displayed on the browser tab and is used by search engines.
3) CSS Inclusion:
Allows linking to external stylesheets using the <link> tag, as seen with styles.css in the code.
4) Scripts and Fonts:
You can include external JavaScript files or web fonts in this section for loading resources before the page is rendered.
5) SEO and Social Sharing:
The <meta> description tag provides a summary of the page for search engines, and additional tags like Open Graph meta tags enhance social media integration.

The <head> is indispensable in most HTML documents for organizing metadata and linking external resources efficiently. Without it, a webpage might not render or function correctly.

NOTE: This tag is meant to be included in the main document that integrates the subpages. The subpage content is usually designed to be inserted into the <body> of the main page dynamically or via server-side inclusion.
Omit Top-Level Tags: Do not include <!DOCTYPE>, <html>, <head>, or <meta> tags in subpages unless the subpage is meant to be a standalone document.
