<html lang="en"> tag is the opening tag of the HTML document and includes the lang attribute, which specifies the primary language of the document's content.
Purpose of the <html> Tag
1) Structural Root: It is the root element of an HTML document, encompassing all content within the page.
2) Defines Document Type: It ensures that the browser recognizes the document as an HTML file.
Purpose of the lang Attribute
Language Identification: The lang="en" attribute specifies that the content of the page is in English. This is crucial for:
1) Accessibility: Screen readers use this to pronounce words correctly based on the language.
2) SEO: Search engines consider the language to provide appropriate results to users based on their preferences.
3) Translation Tools: It helps automatic translators understand the original language of the page.

NOTE: This tag is meant to be included in the main document that integrates the subpages. The subpage content is usually designed to be inserted into the <body> of the main page dynamically or via server-side inclusion.
Omit Top-Level Tags: Do not include <!DOCTYPE>, <html>, <head>, or <meta> tags in subpages unless the subpage is meant to be a standalone document.
