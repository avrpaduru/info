The role attribute in HTML is used to define the role of an element in terms of accessibility. It helps assistive technologies (like screen readers) understand the purpose of an element on the page and how it should be interacted with. The role attribute provides additional context, especially for non-semantic elements or when the meaning of an element isn't clear from its tag alone.

Purpose of the role Attribute:
Improves Accessibility: It helps assistive technologies (like screen readers, Braille displays, and other devices) interpret elements more accurately, enabling users with disabilities to better understand and interact with content.
Enhances Semantic Understanding: It can give additional meaning to elements that don't have inherent semantic roles, like <div> or <span>, allowing these elements to be treated in a more accessible way.
Supports ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications): The role attribute is a key part of ARIA, which is a set of attributes that help make dynamic content and advanced user interface controls accessible to people with disabilities.
Basic Syntax:
<element role="role-name">Content</element>
Commonly Used Roles:
role="button": Identifies an element as a button, allowing screen readers to announce it as a button, even if it's not a native <button> element.
<div role="button">Click me</div>
role="navigation": Indicates a navigation section of the page, which is often used for menus or links.
<div role="navigation">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>
role="main": Defines the main content of the document, helping screen readers skip repetitive content like navigation links or headers.
<main role="main">
  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
  <p>This is the main content.</p>
</main>
role="alert": Specifies that the element is a live region that should be announced immediately by screen readers (e.g., error messages).
<div role="alert">Error: Please fill in all required fields.</div>
role="dialog": Denotes a dialog or modal window.
<div role="dialog">
  <h2>Confirmation</h2>
  <p>Are you sure you want to delete this item?</p>
</div>
role="checkbox": Indicates that the element behaves as a checkbox.
<div role="checkbox" aria-checked="false">Accept Terms</div>
Example of the role Attribute in Use:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Role Attribute Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header role="banner">
        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    </header>

    <nav role="navigation">
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
            <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>

    <main role="main">
        <section>
            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Learn more about our company.</p>
        </section>
    </main>

    <footer role="contentinfo">
        <p>&copy; 2025 My Website</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
In the above example:

The <header> has role="banner", indicating it's the header of the document.
The <nav> has role="navigation", signifying it's a section for navigation links.
The <main> has role="main", marking it as the main content of the page.
The <footer> has role="contentinfo", indicating it's a footer containing metadata or information about the page.
When to Use the role Attribute:
For non-semantic elements: When you use a generic container like <div> or <span>, the role attribute can add meaningful context. For example, a <div> that behaves as a button can have role="button".

To improve accessibility: Use the role attribute to provide a clearer understanding of an element’s function, especially for screen reader users.

When enhancing ARIA-based functionality: The role attribute is essential for creating accessible dynamic content and interactive elements, especially for rich internet applications (RIA).

ARIA Role List:
Here’s a brief list of commonly used ARIA roles:

Document Structure: role="banner", role="navigation", role="main", role="footer", role="heading"
Widgets: role="button", role="checkbox", role="dialog", role="combobox", role="radio", role="slider"
Live Regions: role="alert", role="status", role="log"
Grouping: role="group", role="list", role="listitem", role="table", role="row"

The ARIA roles are part of the Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) specification, which helps make web content and web applications more accessible to people with disabilities. The role attribute allows you to define the purpose or behavior of an element on the page, especially for non-semantic or custom elements.

ARIA roles are categorized into several groups, including document structure, widgets, live regions, and more. These roles help assistive technologies, like screen readers, understand the function of an element and communicate it to users.

Categories of ARIA Roles:
Document Structure Roles: Define the overall structure of the document, such as the header, footer, navigation, etc.

role="banner" – Represents the header of a page.
role="navigation" – Represents navigation links or sections.
role="main" – Denotes the main content of the document.
role="complementary" – Represents content that is complementary to the main content (e.g., sidebar).
role="contentinfo" – Represents footer information (e.g., copyright, legal, etc.).
role="search" – Denotes a search section.
role="heading" – Represents a heading.
