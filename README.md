# info
created this project for only to keep all the info that I have related to all applications at one place :)
For godâ€™s sake, please don't screw this repository. I already lost so much of my notes as I wrote them in books and lost them :(

I will be thankful to anyone who can contribute to expand everyone's knowledge by adding more info to this repository (or maybe correcting any mistakes in this repository).

When you open any topic, all files within that topic will be named starting with a digit indicating the order of which we can read.
