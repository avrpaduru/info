# info
created this project for only to keep all the info that I have related to all applications at one place :)
For god sake, please don't screw this repository. I already lost so much of my notes as I wrote them in books and lost them :(

I will be thankful to anyone who can contribute to expand everyone's knowledge by adding more info to this repository (or maybe correcting any mistakes in this repository).
(As of now this is a private repository :p will make it public and organize the contributions later)
